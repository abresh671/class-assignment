        <h1>South West Academy</h1>
        <p>South West Academy No_1 School is located in the Nefas Silk-Lafto zone, Wordea 12 in the Addis Ababa region of Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>South West Academy No_1 lists their ownernship as Private. This Secondary School in Ethiopia has an enrollment of 867 with the total number of teachers being 68. The school has students from grades 1->4. The Schools address is PO BOX 50010 and their phone number is 114198770</p>
        <p>In my own experiance i don't think South West is the best choice. They are not good at hundling their own school materials like Chemistry lab, Computer lab, physics lap.. and etc.</p>

        <p>School is the place where we start our learning. Apart from learning to read, write, and excel in academics, the school also teaches us valuable life lessons that we can incorporate in our daily lives. It is the place where the foundation of our knowledge and morals are laid. So letâ€™s look at some of the things that are worth remembering about our schools.</p>
